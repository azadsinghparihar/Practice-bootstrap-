                <div><p>Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, abbreviated as RSS (Rāṣṭrīya Svayamsēvaka Saṅgha; IPA: [rɑːʂˈʈriːj(ə) swəjəmˈseːvək ˈsəŋɡʱ], lit. "National Volunteer Organisation"[12] or "National Patriotic Organisation"[13]), is an Indian right-wing, Hindu nationalist, paramilitary volunteer organisation that is widely regarded as the parent organisation of the ruling party of India, the Bharatiya Janata Party.[4][1][5][14] The RSS is one of the principal organizations of the Sangh Parivar group.

                Founded on 27 September 1925, and claiming a commitment to selfless service to India.[15]the organisation is the world's largest voluntary missionary organization.[16]

                The initial impetus was to provide character training through Hindu discipline and to unite the Hindu community to form a Hindu Rashtra (Hindu nation).[17][18] The organisation promotes the ideals of upholding Indian culture and the values of a civil society.[19] It drew initial inspiration from European right-wing groups during World War II.[18] Gradually, RSS grew into a prominent Hindu nationalist umbrella organisation, spawning several affiliated organisations that established numerous schools, charities, and clubs to spread its ideological beliefs.[18]

                The RSS was banned once during British rule,[18] and then thrice by the post-independence Indian government – first in 1948 when a former RSS member[20] assassinated Mahatma Gandhi;[18][21][22] then during the emergency (1975–77); and for a third time after the demolition of Babri Masjid in 1992.</p></div>
