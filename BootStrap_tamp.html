                    <h1>Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh</h1>
                    <p>Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, abbreviated as RSS (Rāṣṭrīya Svayamsēvaka Saṅgha; IPA: [rɑːʂˈʈriːj(ə) swəjəmˈseːvək ˈsəŋɡʱ], lit. "National Volunteer Organisation"[12] or "National Patriotic Organisation"[13]), is an Indian right-wing, Hindu nationalist, paramilitary volunteer organisation that is widely regarded as the parent organisation of the ruling party of India, the Bharatiya Janata Party.[4][1][5][14] The RSS is one of the principal organizations of the Sangh Parivar group.

                        Founded on 27 September 1925, and claiming a commitment to selfless service to India.[15]the organisation is the world's largest voluntary missionary organization.[16]

                        The initial impetus was to provide character training through Hindu discipline and to unite the Hindu community to form a Hindu Rashtra (Hindu nation).[17][18] The organisation promotes the ideals of upholding Indian culture and the values of a civil society.[19] It drew initial inspiration from European right-wing groups during World War II.[18] Gradually, RSS grew into a prominent Hindu nationalist umbrella organisation, spawning several affiliated organisations that established numerous schools, charities, and clubs to spread its ideological beliefs.[18]

                        The RSS was banned once during British rule,[18] and then thrice by the post-independence Indian government – first in 1948 when a former RSS member[20] assassinated Mahatma Gandhi;[18][21][22] then during the emergency (1975–77); and for a third time after the demolition of Babri Masjid in 1992.</p>

                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <p>History Founding

                        RSS was founded in 1925 by Keshav Baliram Hedgewar, a doctor in the city of Nagpur, British India.[23] He had earlier been charged with sedition in 1921 by the British Administration and was imprisoned for one year.[24]

                        Hedgewar was educated by his elder brother. He then decided to study medicine in Calcutta, West Bengal. He was sent there by B. S. Moonje in 1910 to pursue his medical studies. There he lived with Shyam Sundar Chakravarthy[25] and learned the techniques of fighting from secret revolutionary organisations like the Anushilan Samiti and Jugantar in Bengal. He is sa

                        d to have joined Anushilan Samiti, and he had contacts with revolutionaries such as Ram Prasad Bismil.[26]

                        Previously,[clarification needed] he was involved in such type[clarification needed] of revolutionary activities, a fact disclosed by writers such as C. P. Bhishikar,[27] M. S. Golwalkar[28] K. S. Sudarshan[29] and Rakesh Sinha.[30]

                        After completing his studies and graduating, he returned to Nagpur, inspired by the armed movement.[clarification needed] In his memoirs, the third chief of RSS, Balasahab Deoras narrates an incident when Hedgewar saved him and others from following the path of Bhagat Singh and his comrades.[clarification needed][31] Later, in 1925, Hedgewar left the revolutionary organisations and formed the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh.
                        Since Hedgewar was primarily associated with the Hindustan Republican Association, he adopted the full constitution of the erstwhile HRA[clarification needed] and later implemented it forcibly[clarification needed] in his newly established organisation, the RSS. The RSS first met in 1925 just two months after the Kakori train robbery in a small ground[clarification needed] of Nagpur with five to six people on Vijaya Dashami.[not in citation given] After the formation of the RSS, Hedgewar kept the organisation from having any direct affiliation with the political organisations then fighting British rule,[33] but he and his team of volunteers did take part in the Indian National Congress and lead movements against British rule. Hedgewar was arrested in the Jungle Satyagraha agitation in 1931 and served a second term in prison.</p>
